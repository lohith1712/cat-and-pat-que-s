1)	Write a C program that accepts a string as input, print the length of the string and display the word frequency, then use pointers to find the first repeated and non-repeated character in the string, and print the output:
POSSIBLE TEST CASES:
INPUT:
SUJITHRA
OUTPUT:
Length of the string is: 8
Word frequency is: 8
No repeated characters found in the string.
First non-repeated character is: S
#2 INPUT:
ASSDFG
OUTPUT:
    Length of the string is: 6
Word frequency is: 5
First repeated character is: S
First non-repeated character is: A
 #3 INPUT:
RUDRESH
OUTPUT:
Length of the string is: 7
Word frequency is: 6
First repeated character is: R
First non-repeated character is: U
Answer:

#include <string.h>
#define MAX_LENGTH 100
