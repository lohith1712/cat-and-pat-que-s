The temperature in Chennai exists somewhere between 280C to 330C in a particular week. The temperature in Delhi is 8 0C lesser than in Chennai. Likewise, the temperature in Haveri is 5 0C more than that of Chennai. Write a C program to find the temperature of Gangtok for a particular week, which is the temperature difference between Delhi and Haveri. Get the temperature of Chennai ( 0C) as input for the week of 7 days and the temperature of Gangtok ( 0C) as output for the week of 7 days. Implement the program using arrays and validate the rules.
Answer: 
#include <stdio.h>
#define DAYS 7
int main() {
    int chennai[DAYS], delhi[DAYS], haveri[DAYS], gangtok[DAYS];
    int i;
    printf("Enter the temperature of Chennai for the week:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < DAYS; i++) {
        scanf("%d", &chennai[i]);
        if (chennai[i] < 28 || chennai[i] > 33) {
            printf("Invalid temperature for Chennai. Temperature should be between 28C and 33C.\n");
            return 1;
        }
    }
for (i = 0; i < DAYS; i++) {
        delhi[i] = chennai[i] - 8;
        haveri[i] = chennai[i] + 5;
    }
for (i = 0; i < DAYS; i++) {
        gangtok[i] = haveri[i] - delhi[i];
    }
    printf("\nTemperature of Gangtok for the week:\n");
    for (i = 0; i < DAYS; i++) {
        printf("%dC ", gangtok[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
